/*
  First off, notice the leading slash. This means its on the EXACT same domain that the page was served from.
  That means it just appends that url to the domain. So any products with that kind of link tag can't be the YEEZY
  according to the domain rule. Another thing to consider is the product name/handle, while this may not be exact,
  it most likely will have something to do with footwear. In addition to this, we can look at YEEZYSUPPLY before
  the password goes up and cache all the product ID's that are loaded and compare them later on
   to see if anything was added(even if the product handle/url is funky)
